##Objective:
To generate a first-order estimate of the potential effects of climate change on annual wildfire acreage.


##Methods:
Fire history data for New Mexico from 1980 to 2015 were obtained from:  http://wildfire.cr.usgs.gov/firehistory/data.html.  
These were used in conjunction with GHCN daily temperature and precipitation data from the same time period for 63 New 
Mexico weather stations that had >95% data coverage for the study period to test relationships between weather 
(temperature and precip) and annual acres burned.

After models were developed, future climate projections from LOCA were used to estimate future burn acreage (climatic 
drivers only...no modification of fuels or ignition sources).
